Just some ideas- 

UI enhancements (more involved animations, avatars, a mariachi band, a smiling horse in a cowboy hat, etc.)
More standard betting options (i.e. double, split, insurance, surrender).
Implement standard, or basic game strategy for use in tutorial or advice option, or to add other computer players.
Add different strategies to allow player to select less or more aggressive play style for themselves and their opponents. 
See stats for career wins/winnings.
